    "The key to effective prompt engineering is not about knowing the perfect prompt, but about having a good process to develop prompts that are effective for the specific application. This often involves developing and evaluating the prompt against a large set of cases. The process is iterative and requires trial and error, but with patience and persistence, a prompt can be refined to achieve the desired results."
