This includes translating text from one language to another, correcting spelling and grammar, and transforming formats such as HTML to JSON. These capabilities can simplify tasks that were previously implemented using regular expressions.\n",
    "## Translation Capabilities\n",
    "Large language models are trained on a vast amount of text from various sources, including the internet, which is in many different languages. This training enables the model to perform translation tasks. The models are proficient in hundreds of languages to varying degrees.\n",
